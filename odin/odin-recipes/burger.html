        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop pan to medium-high heat.</li>

        <li>Grill or cook the patties in the pan for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>While the burgers cook, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Once the patties are done, place each one on the bottom half of a bun.</li>
        <li>Top the patty with a slice of cheese, followed by lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles (if using).</li>
        <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, and/or mayonnaise on the top bun, then place it on top of the burger.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite side, like fries or a salad. Enjoy your homemade burger!</li>
