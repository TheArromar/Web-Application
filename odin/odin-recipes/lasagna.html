    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic, cooking until the beef is browned and the onions are soft.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and egg, mixing until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and another layer of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat layering the noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and meat sauce until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top layer of sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
