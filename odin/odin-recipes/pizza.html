    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and optional garlic powder and oregano. Create a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions if you're making two pizzas.</li>
        <li>Roll each portion into a circle (or any shape you prefer) on a floured surface, aiming for a thickness of about 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled dough on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread an even layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
